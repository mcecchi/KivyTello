# KivyTello
Kivy app to control your Ryze Tello
Very simple python app to drive your Ryze Tello from desktop or smartphone.
It uses Kivy (https://kivy.org) to create a basic platform independent GUI.
I still haven't compiled KivyTello for Android due to lack of time,
all volunteers are welcome!

Many thanks to https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy for his great Tello library!
